## Jupyter on the JVM

Where to first?

### I want to write a Jupyter kernel.

Great! Coercing your interpreter into a Jupyter kernel should be no problem. Extend the base kernel, provide a few details about your language, and implement `eval(String)`. Check out the link:writing-kernels.adoc[Writing Jupyter Kernels on the JVM] article for a full example and tutorial.

### I want to connect to an existing Jupyter kernel.

The `jupyter-jvm-client` is the library you are looking for. It provides the functionality to _locate_, _spawn_, and _communicate_ with Jupyter kernels. Check out the link:connecting-to-kernels.adoc[Connecting to a Jupyter kernel from the JVM] article for a full example and tutorial.

### I want to make my library work nicely inside a JVM kernel.

Hooking into the display or magics functionality should be done here at the most generic level. All kernels that extend the base should work well with these extensions.

Learn about choosing and customizing a data format for your (or someone else's!) classes, creating magics, or getting a little more interactive with a widget in link:authoring-extensions[Authoring Jupyter Kernel Extensions].
